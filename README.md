Probably considered one of the hardest and most famous unsolved problems in mathematicst, sometimes called the 3X+1 problem, it is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, in 1937. The conjecture asks if given an odd number, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, while given an even number, the next term is divided by 2. It is conjectured that these sequences will go on and always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
